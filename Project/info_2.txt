Utahraptor was a large theropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous period, about 125 million years ago.
It was one of the largest raptors, measuring around 7 meters long and weighing up to 500 kilograms. Known for its sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot,
which was likely used for hunting, Utahraptor was a powerful predator with strong hindlimbs and sharp claws.

It lived in what is now Utah, in a warm, semi-arid environment with forests and floodplains. Discovered in 1991,
Utahraptor has provided valuable insights into the evolution of raptors and remains a fascinating subject for dinosaur enthusiasts.
