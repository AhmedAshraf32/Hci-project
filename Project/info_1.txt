Tyrannosaurus Rex: One of the largest land carnivores of all time, known for its massive jaws and powerful legs.
    
    Tyrannosaurus rex lived in what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia.
    Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations
    dating to the Maastrichtian age of the upper Cretaceous period, 68 to 66 million years ago.
    
    The large size and predatory nature of Tyrannosaurus rex has led to it being one of the best-known dinosaurs since
    the early 20th century, and it has been featured in numerous films, advertisements, and other media.
    
    Tyrannosaurus rex was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Its forelimbs were short
    but unusually powerful for their size and had two clawed digits. It is thought that they may have been used for
    grasping during feeding or mating. Its bite force is estimated to be among the strongest of any terrestrial animal.
