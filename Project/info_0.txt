Triceratops: A herbivorous dinosaur known for its large bony frill and three horns on its face.
    
    Triceratops lived in what is now North America during the late Cretaceous period, around 68 to 66 million years ago.
    They were one of the last non-avian dinosaur genera to appear before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.
    
    The name Triceratops, which literally means "three-horned face", is derived from the Greek words "tri" meaning three,
    "keras" meaning horn, and "ops" meaning face. This genus is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the
    subject of significant scientific study.
    
    Triceratops was a large, quadrupedal herbivore with a frilled skull and three facial horns. They are believed to have
    lived in herds and displayed complex social behavior. The frill may have been used for defense, display, or
    thermoregulation. Their teeth were arranged in groups called batteries that formed a shearing surface, enabling them
    to cut through tough vegetation.
